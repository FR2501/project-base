# project-base
Base setup for Java/Maven projects with simple CI integration.

Clone or copy ZIP archive from github, then execute run.sh to change name of the project from "project-base" to your custom name (i.e. "./run.sh custom_name" for a project named custom_name). Then, navigate to the project directory and run "mvn package", should execute without errors.

# TODO
- Automatically change package names from "com.fr2501.x" to something supplied by the user.
